# Blush-Pomodoro-Timer
Final project for CM3- Fahnam Naqvi & Siddhi Pareek (BOS 2)

Let's start this READ ME with a little fact, Pomodoro in Italian means Tomato, now you must be questioning why am I telling you this? To that the answer is you will see. Both of us very often stuggled with our attention span, getting distracted after every 5 minutes, or procastinating till last minute, or if we with Gods miracle saved ourselves from that we always ended up just doing things without actually learning. Therefore we though of this timer is a certified techinque which actaully help people, and we are a big belivers help youself before helping others, so we made somthing that we will use, even if other won't. 

To give a explanation of the bigger picture, so I can anwer you earlier question, our timer looks like a tomato beacuse going of of what pomodoro means in Italian. At first we wanted the tomato to be a  hand clock, but due to lack of time and experiance with coding we choose a less complicated option and went with the digital clock. we wanted it too look cute as, we are just girls to make us use something it have to be cute and pretty. Are we proud of it? For sure we are, this timer took blood and sweat, so it's our baby. 

And, just like humans it also have flaws which we will dive into later. 

We used Gemini and Deep Seek to get the code (But, we made sure that we know how each line of code - which will be back of by the viva). 

Our code consist of 6 function: 2 for python and 4 in Gava Script - yea we know thats out of the requrirement but, the reason behing that is that we didn't know how to create the virtual environment (which was the requirement for Python) so we left it there choosing something over nothing. 

Explaining the Functionality: 

Project.py
The main function for the Project.py is flask which make sure we are able to create a web page (which is what are project is), and to direct it to html the second function in the file, and that to be sure that the code run smootly by the first function being a debug. Additionally, as we mentioned before that because we did not know how to install a virtual environment we were not able to do  main coding in python instead we choose Gava leading to us only having 2 funcions in Project.py file. 

Requiremnts.txt:

This file just constain Flask and and pytest (which is just a python debuger) 

Test_project.py:

This file making the testing of the code smooth. when this runs, it automatically detects and executed all functions prefixed with test_. and for each test function, the client fixture is passed as an argument, providing access to the client. 

Script.js:

This is what our main code is, though this is in Gava script we can still read it - just saying. Talking about the functions of this script the first function is about the start time. The 2nd main function is about the stop time interval. the third main function is about the 25 min intervcal of the pomodoro timer. and than last but not the least the 4th ifunction is about the break times. 

Style.css: 

This file is all about the design of the timer. This was very crucial for us as we didn't wnat to make anything, we wanted to make a cute timer. So this is the file/ code that mades the font Arial in size two, thing on the webpage centered with the height of 100vh. color which I will leave for your curiosity as (the project is named blush and the name is pomodoro that now you know the italian translation of - so go try it and figure it out. I will not bore you with all the details of the timer, as you can see it when u try it - we belive on the visual appeal. but just to give a essense of it all this is the file that made us achive our secondry goal.
